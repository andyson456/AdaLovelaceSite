    <p>Charles Babbage first met Ada Lovelace in 1833. Babbage later introduced Lovelace to his<br />
    prototype of the Difference Engine, which she immediately became fascinated with. After the<br />
    failured attempt of the Difference Engine, he later created the Analytical Engine, which was<br />
    designed to be a fully-fledged general purpose computation matchine. It was Ada Lovelace that<br />
    developed an algorithm that would allow the engine to calculate a sequence of numbers, more<br />
    specifically a sequence of Bernoulli Numbers.</p>
