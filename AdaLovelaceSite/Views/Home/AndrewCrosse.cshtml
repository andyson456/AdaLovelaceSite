        Andrew Crosse was an English scientist who was most known for being an early pioneer<br />
        in the study and use of electricity. Crosse is most known for an electrocrystallization<br />
        experiment he performed in 1836 that resulted in insects appearing, causing people at the<br />
        time to believe he was 'creating' insects. Crosse was an acquaintance of Ada Lovelace,<br />
        and would consult each other often.
