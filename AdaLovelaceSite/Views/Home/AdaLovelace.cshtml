            <p>Augusta Ada Byron (aka Ada Lovelace) was born in December 10, 1815 to Anne Isabella</p>
        <p>Milbanke and George Goradan Byron. She is the only legitimate daughter of of famous</p>
        <p>Lord Byron, who was a leading figure in the Romantic Movement in the early 1800's.</p>
        <p>Lovelace was known from an early age to show a passion for mathematics and science.</p>
            <p>It wasn't until 1833 that Lovelace met the well know mathematician and inventor, Charles</p>
        <p>Babbage, who at the time was most known for his work on the Difference Engine. After Babbage</p>
        <p>discontinued work on the Difference Engine, he started working on the Analytical Engine,</p>
        <p>which was a machine that designed to order whatever particular sequencce of operations</p>
        <p>was needed. Though Babbage was the mastermind behind the Analytical Engine, it was Lovelac'se</p>
        <p>knowledge of the Bernoulli Numbers that allowed the Analytical Engine to perform an </p>
        <p>operation. She was able to figure out how she could get the Analytical Engine to run by</p>
        <p>designing the first algorithm or 'program', which is why she is often regarded as the first</p>
        <p>computer programmer.</p>
